<h2> About me </h2>

ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in Software Engineering & DevOps. 

ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying Computer Science & networking at ESIEE Amiens. I have a bachelor Degree in computer science (major in software programming).

During my Master of Science, I'm IT engineer at L'OrÃ©al in one of the group's factory. My main activity is to automate and manage the IT infrastucture of the plant.
