ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m not Philip J. Fry but Guillaume ROHEE ! 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software engineering (python, C# & C/C++), DevOps (git, ansible, docker, Jenkins...), Automation (python & PowerShell) and Cloud Computing.

ðŸŽ“ I am currently a student at ESIEE Amiens and an apprentice IT engineer at L'OrÃ©al.

At the end of my engineering studies, I would like to work in a job that allows me to touch these different areas, especially the Cloud.
